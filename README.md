üìå Project Overview
This project presents a supervised machine learning solution for the classification of news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model leverages the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle and employs Logistic Regression for classification tasks. Emphasis has been placed on model interpretability, accessibility, and reproducibility, making it ideal for educational purposes. The model achieved a commendable accuracy of 92% and is supplemented with a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time prediction and visualization.
